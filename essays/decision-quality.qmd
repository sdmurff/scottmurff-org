High-quality decisions are the foundation of effective strategy and good stewardship. I've developed a framework for decision quality built around three core components:

## The Three Components

1. **Information Quality**
   Do you have the right facts? High-quality information means you have access to or knowledge of information that is relevant, timely, and correct.

2. **Reasoning Quality**
   Are you making sense of the information logically to formulate your plan of action? This requires clear mental models, structured problem solving, and emotional regulation.

3. **Execution Quality**
   Are you executing with a high degree of fidelity? Even the best plans fail without disciplined follow-through. Execution quality is about ensuring that decisions translate into coordinated, consistent action.

## The Framework

This can be visualized conceptually as a simple equation:

$$
\text{Outcome Quality} = f(\text{Information Quality}, \text{Reasoning Quality}, \text{Execution Quality})
$$

Each component is necessary but not sufficient on its own—you need all three. For example:

- Great reasoning applied to poor information yields confident mistakes.
- Great information and great reasoning without execution produces no impact.
- Strong execution of a poor decision leads to failure faster.

This model draws inspiration from both classic strategy frameworks and contemporary research on decision-making under uncertainty.
