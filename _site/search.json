    "text": "About\nI‚Äôm Scott Murff, a professor, researcher, and entrepreneur focused on strategy, artificial intelligence, and decision-making. I currently teach in the Strategic Management program at Brigham Young University‚Äôs Marriott School of Business, where I help students build the skills and mindsets to thrive and deliver real value to organizations right out of school.\nBefore joining BYU, I spent over 15 years working at the intersection of data science, product management, and consulting. My experience includes:\n\nMcKinsey & Company: As a Principal Product Manager and Engagement Manager, I helped clients across industries drive performance transformations, build analytics capabilities, and design AI-powered solutions. I also led the development of a performance management platform and helped McKinsey productize it‚Äôs company transformation approach that has had $100B of CFO-certified impact across client engagements.\nZions Bancorporation: I led teams developing quantitative models to forecast multi-billion-dollar balance sheets and income statements, and pioneered the use of open-source tools within regulated banking environments.\nU.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: As a Research Analyst, I co-authored peer-reviewed research on loan modifications and conducted statistical analysis of massive financial datasets.\n\nI hold a master‚Äôs degree in Management Science & Engineering from Stanford University and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics from Brigham Young University.\nMy work today centers on:\n\nAI Enabled Product Management: Exploring how artificial intelligence can accelerate innovation\nStrategy and Management Consulting: Helping students build skills for structured problem-solving, rigorous analysis, and clear communication.\nTeaching and Mentorship: Coaching students as they develop confidence, technical skills, and purpose in their careers.\n\nOutside the classroom, I conduct research and build products that I hope can improve people‚Äôs lives mentally, physically, and spiritually."

    "text": "This page collects essays, models, and reflections on strategy, decision-making, and the pursuit of a meaningful life. My goal is to share ideas that help individuals and organizations make better choices, navigate uncertainty, and build a fulfilling life.\n\n\nJesus can be seen as the most revolutionary person to ever live. How so?\nHe overthrew the most dominant force on earth: human nature.\nHuman nature says: despise your enemies, Jesus taught: ‚Äúlove them‚Äù\nHuman nature says: don‚Äôt put boundaries on me, Jesus taught: ‚Äúnot my will‚Äù only and ‚Äúdeny yourself‚Äù\nHuman nature says: dominate others, Jesus taught: ‚Äúhe that is greatest among you shall be your servant‚Äù\nPerhaps the most knowledgeable world historian ever, the person who literally wrote the 11-volume Story of Civilization, Will Durrant, who did not himself believe in the divinity of Jesus, was asked who his most admired person in history was. His instantaneous response: ‚Äúwithout any doubt, I would say Jesus Christ.‚Äù His teachings are ‚Äúenormously important to living in a social order.‚Äù They are ‚Äúenormously desirable as a counter action to our natural individualism‚Äù\nAnother historian observed that beyond his role in Christianity, Jesus is a ‚Äúfigure of significance in Islam, a messenger of God who appears in the Qur‚Äôan. Many Hindus and Buddhists have interpreted him favourably within the perspectives of their own traditions. Recently, some Jewish thinkers have been reclaiming Jesus as an authentically Jewish teacher. There have been appreciative Marxist readings of Jesus. There are New Age versions of Jesus. Moreover, respecting Jesus while denouncing the church has become a common attitude.‚Äù\nEven so, it‚Äôs common and easy to criticize and blame Jesus and religious traditions for numberless human conflicts. This criticism and judgement is misplaced. Human nature will always find plenty to fight about, it doesn‚Äôt need help from religion. On the contrary, the teachings of Jesus (many of which are shared by other faith traditions) are the most powerful forces on earth to overcome the destructive parts of human nature.\nWhy is all this relevant for a professional audience? Because many of the revolutionary teachings of Jesus are exactly those that would help employees and by extension businesses thrive.\nSo regardless of whether you call yourself atheist, agnostic, christian, buddhist, jewish, muslim, hindu, unaffiliated, or something else, we can all be grateful for the teachings of Jesus. The same should be said for the wise words from all of history‚Äôs other great teachers.\nHow is it that, 2,000 year after he was born, we are still talking about a man from an obscure village with no wealth, political office, or military power?\nWe each form our own answer to that question but one thing I believe is: ‚Äúthere is no greater, more thrilling, and more soul-ennobling challenge than to try to learn of Christ and walk in His steps.‚Äù\n\n\n\nBelow is a diagram that captures important relationships between what we believe and what is true. A critical goal in life is aligning our beliefs with what is true.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach intersection or segment represents a specific combination of belief and truth, leading to the defined categories listed below:\n\nKnowledge\nThe intersection of Belief and Truth when the evidence is high. Represents the things you believe that are true for which there is a high degree of evidence proving their truth.\nTrue Faith\nThe intersection of Belief and Truth with limited evidence. Represents things you believe that are true but for which there is limited evidence proving their truth.\nVain Faith\nPart of Belief but outside Truth, with limited evidence. Represents things you believe that are actually false and for which there is limited evidence proving their falsehood.\nDelusion\nPart of Belief but outside Truth, with high evidence that it is false (but evidence is ignored). Represents the things that a person believes which are false, and for which there is a high degree of evidence they are false but that the person ignores or discounts.\nUnawareness\nPart of Truth because it is known by others with high evidence, but outside of Belief for a given person because of their lack of awareness of the available evidence.\nUnexplored\nPart of Truth but not yet Belief because it hasn‚Äôt been discovered or confirmed. Represents undiscovered truths.\n\nA color gradient is used as a visual enhancement within both circles, including the intersected portion. It runs bottom to top starting with white and ending with dark blue at the top. The gradient represents the degree of evidence available for a given proposition that would fall in one of the categories. Dark blue would be 100% evidence and white would be 0% evidence.\nWhat can we learn from this diagram?\n\nBy definition, it‚Äôs impossible to know with complete certainty if a given assertion, for which only limited evidence is available, is true faith or false faith. Only as more evidence accumulates will this become clear.\nIt‚Äôs likely the case that everyone can see themself in each segment of the diagram.\n\nBecause of this, we should be patient with ourselves and others as we gradually refine our understanding.\nWe should be forgiving of ourselves and others when beliefs later prove to be misplaced.\nWe should adopt a spirit of humility as we continue to seek more truth and allow our beliefs to be refined as new evidence emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-quality decisions are the foundation of effective strategy and good stewardship. I‚Äôve developed a framework for decision quality built around three core components:\n\nInformation Quality\nDo you have the right facts? High-quality information means you have access to or knowledge of information that is relevant, timely, and correct.\nReasoning Quality\nAre you making sense of the information logically to formulate your plan of action? This requires clear mental models, structured problem solving, and emotional regulation.\nExecution Quality\nAre you executing with a high degree of fidelity? Even the best plans fail without disciplined follow-through. Execution quality is about ensuring that decisions translate into coordinated, consistent action.\n\nThis can be visualized conceptually as a simple equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Outcome Quality} = f(\\text{Information Quality}, \\text{Reasoning Quality}, \\text{Execution Quality})\n\\]\nEach component is necessary but not sufficient on it‚Äôs own, you need all three. For example:\n\nGreat reasoning applied to poor information yields confident mistakes.\nGreat information and great reasoning without execution produces no impact.\nStrong execution of a poor decision leads to failure faster.\n\nThis model draws inspiration from both classic strategy frameworks and contemporary research on decision-making under uncertainty.\nFull article coming soon."
